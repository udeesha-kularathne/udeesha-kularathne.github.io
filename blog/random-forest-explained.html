    <p>
        Random Forest is one of the most dependable machine learning algorithms
        for structured data. Its strength does not come from clever mathematics
        or complex optimization, but from a simple and surprisingly powerful
        idea: combine many unreliable models into a single reliable system.
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand why Random Forest works so well, it helps to understand
        what goes wrong when we rely on just one decision tree.
    </p>

    <h2>A Very Simple Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine asking one person to make an important decision. Even if they
        are intelligent, they will sometimes be wrong. Their judgment is shaped
        by limited information and personal bias.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now imagine asking hundreds of people, each seeing the problem from a
        slightly different angle. While some will still be wrong, extreme
        mistakes tend to cancel out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Random Forest applies this same idea to decision trees.
    </p>

    <h2>Why a Single Decision Tree Is Not Enough</h2>
    <p>
        Decision trees are powerful because they can model complex, non-linear
        relationships. Unfortunately, this flexibility makes them prone to
        overfitting.
    </p>
    <p>
        A single tree can learn very specific rules that perfectly explain the
        training data but fail badly on new data. Small changes in the dataset
        can produce completely different trees.
    </p>
    <p>
        This instability is the core weakness Random Forest is designed to fix.
    </p>

    <h2>Bootstrapping: Teaching Trees Differently</h2>
    <p>
        Random Forest introduces diversity through bootstrapping. Each tree is
        trained on a randomly sampled version of the dataset, drawn with
        replacement.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, some samples appear multiple times in one tree and not at
        all in another. This forces trees to learn different patterns, even
        though they all originate from the same data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bootstrapping alone already improves stability, but Random Forest goes
        one step further.
    </p>

    <h2>Feature Randomness: Preventing Identical Thinking</h2>
    <p>
        If every tree always chose splits from the same strongest features,
        the forest would behave like many copies of the same tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        Random Forest avoids this by restricting each split to a random subset
        of features. Trees are forced to explore alternative explanations and
        interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This feature-level randomness is what makes the ensemble truly diverse.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding n_estimators</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>n_estimators</code> parameter controls how many trees are
        included in the forest. With very few trees, predictions are unstable.
        As more trees are added, variance decreases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond a certain point, adding more trees improves consistency rather
        than accuracy. This is why Random Forest rarely overfits as the number
        of trees grows.
    </p>

    <pre><code>from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=300,
    max_depth=None,
    random_state=42
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)</code></pre>

    <h2>Bias, Variance, and Why Random Forest Works</h2>
    <p>
        Random Forest primarily targets variance. Individual trees may overfit,
        but averaging their predictions smooths out extreme behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is why Random Forest performs well even with default parameters.
        It trades a small amount of bias for a large reduction in variance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result is a model that generalizes reliably across many datasets.
    </p>

    <h2>Interpretability and Feature Importance</h2>
    <p>
        While a single tree is easy to interpret, a forest is not. However,
        Random Forest still provides useful insights through feature importance
        measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        These scores indicate which features contribute most to reducing
        uncertainty across the ensemble, making Random Forest a practical
        compromise between performance and interpretability.
    </p>

    <h2>When Should You Use Random Forest?</h2>
    <p>
        Random Forest is an excellent choice for structured and tabular data,
        especially when datasets are noisy or moderately sized.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is commonly used as a baseline model in production systems because
        it is robust, easy to tune, and difficult to break.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Random Forest succeeds because it accepts a fundamental truth:
        individual models are imperfect.
    </p>
    <p>
        By embracing randomness and averaging many imperfect trees, it produces
        predictions that are stable, reliable, and surprisingly powerful.
